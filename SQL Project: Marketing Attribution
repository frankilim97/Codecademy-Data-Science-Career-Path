Which 5 campaigns should CoolTShirts reinvest in?
weekly newsletter, retargetting ad, retargetting campaign and paid search were the top 4 most likely to lead to a purchase. The last campaign should be 'getting to know cool tshirts' because this campaign led to one of the highest numbers of first touches and last touches.
