-- What is the reason for this? The questions become increasingly specific and people get less and less certain about these answers. There is a greater drop from question 4 to 5 perhaps because many people do not know when their last eye exam was. However a quick check (below) shows that there is a "Not Sure. Let's Skip It" response option which should have helped with the response rates.
